This was a Java game I created using LIBGDX, a free and open-source game-development application framework.

The goal is quite simple: Get the ball into the portal at the top while avoiding the blades and keeping the ball on the platform. Once the ball reaches the portal, it moves on to the next level of infinte levels, with increasing blades amount.

Here is the home screen of the game:

Below are the instructions on how to play the game.
